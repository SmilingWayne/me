# 笑笑的网站<br>xiaoxiao's website

🇨🇳你好！🇬🇧Hello! 🇫🇷Bonjour! 🇪🇸Hola! 🇷🇺привет! 🇸🇦 مرحباً 

- 😃 我是笑笑，一个普通人。这里是我的个人网站！

- 🥰 很高兴能在网络世界和你相遇。希望你也喜欢这个安静的小田园，不妨进来小坐，浅尝一杯咖啡。

- 🚀 最初是个人知识库，后来变成知识分享站，现在偶尔发挥情绪回收厂的作用。时不时会出现一些知识干货或者碎碎念。

- 💪 目标是让文字与记录在这里野蛮生长。

> English Translation:

- 😃 My name is `"xiaoxiao"` (Pronounced as "/ɕjɑʊ˥˩/ /ɕjɑʊ˥˩/" in [IPA](https://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org). In Mandarin It means "**Smile!** 😊", of course another anagram "Slime" is also my nickname), an ordinary person. This is my personal website!

- 🥰 Thrilled to meet you here in cyber world! Hope you also like this quiet little oasis. Feel free to drop by for some rest, with maybe a cup of coffee~


- 🚀 Initially, it was a personal knowledge base, later 
evolved into knowledge-sharing platform, recently, it occasionally serves as my emotion-catharsis plant. You may see some knowledge sharing or personal thoughts from time to time. 

- 💪 The goal is to let my words and records grow freely and wildly here.

- 思绪借助身体的行走...
> 通感～修辞手法
>
> The abandoned capital:废都

- Difference btwen philosophical Formalism:
    - form is part of contents. SO the change of form also push the revolution of contents.

- Romanticism period: Expression.
- Modern period: 
    - psycho analysis
    - emotional analysis

- **focus on the text** instead of the author(creator, inner experience).
    - moral education?
    - pergen?
    - catharsis(?, 情感宣泄？)
    - ethetic appreciation.
- **focus on the reader** as a role of literary studies is brought to the front.


- objective correlative(powerful ways of ), a not direct descrption;

Evolutionary Stages
1. 1920s early conceptualization
2. 1930s40s spread, more vigor 九叶派诗人 nine 
3. 1950s lost（accepted by later writers.）
4. after 1950s, institutionalized and naturalized 


## CHaracteristics:

1. eliminate extrinstic(external / outside, like religion, history and things.) concerns.
2. explore the structure of a work:
      1. assemble rather than cutting them.
3. **organic**, system
4. closely reading. very very close, details very matter, **scrutinizing.**. Scrutiny
5. distinguish literature from religion and morality



## Ideological position

```
- which is classical? what is the standard? what is the value?
- politically conservative, Turn to tradition(Aristotles / Plato / Roman classics)
```

- Culture diversity: The Islamic contribution: Not western dominant. Islam makes it more connected with the other world.
- Use formalist protocals.
- genetic and receptionist approaches denied.(be careful, **intentional fallacies**, 过于强调作者，是在吧自己的意图强加给作者，用来批评传统的把批评家自己的观念强加给作者并复制给文本； affective fallacies强调文本对读者的影响)
- theological notion of metaphor，过于强调“一种相同的认识”，无法解释长篇巨著。
- posit the ideal reader: 读者



## strategies of NC 
- attention on the work
- not allergic t talking about the responses of readers or the intentions of authors.
- close reading of literary work revealing its complexity, for they maintain that great literature contains oppositions ambiguities ironies.(to locate these issues, to put together these ? to formulate the idea(meaning)of text)

- Foreign studies: improvement. not a swallow academic 教训本身就是知识。


## 3 step procedure

- read closely: identify oppositions.
- read closely: assume that everything in the work is carefully calculated to contribute to the work's unity
    - all factories are lack of heads.( 转译 ) figures of speeches. 

## Nex 

- work out the problem, reread.

- **poor life**: 
    - live in a confined world/ not much vitality
    - pooor life 


## cleanth brooks articles of faith
- (literary criticism) a description and an evalution of its object
- primary concern of criticism is with the problem of unity
- form is meaning.
- literature is ultimatrly metaphoric and symbolic 
- moral problems are the subject matter of literature but the purpose of literature is not to point a moral.

- 感受的迷雾不能影响我们的批评。

## Methods of NC 
- incorporate within the work the impersonal feelings and emotions common to mankind 
- intentional fallacy 
- 意图迷雾和感受迷雾
- careful read / exact scrutiny 
- theory to be applied
    - rhyme, meter, setting, characterization and plot were used to identify the plot
    - NC looked fror paradox, ambiguity irony     
    - literature is words on a PAGE.
    - How words on page create meaning? without anything referce to outside. "INTRINSIC"

- Motionless in time
- night entangled tress.
- The moon is just there. Like moon like is following behind
    - a poem should equal to not true.
    - 以完整的形式呈现给读者，而不是告诉读者有什么意义；
    - A poem should not mean, but be;


## How to understand the Text?

     
## major criticism

- radical formalist stance is too rigid
- objectivist stance is false 
- ideological position is hidden
- some humanist assumptions are unarticulated.
- readings often come to the same conclusion. 

- From literature as an aesthetic object to literature as a social (historical) practice
- Lit. crit.- no longer neutral, or "disinterested," it is conditioned, or programmed; depends on our past experience, our framework.
- Functions of lit. theory --
- It can make us become a self-conscious critic; know more about literature, look at it from different perspectives, understand and historicize our own perspective, as well as others' perspectives.
- Theory becomes an independent school of study.
- To articulate this framework and piece together the various elements of our practical criticism into a coherent, unified body of knowledge is to formulate our literary theory.

- 他们本身就是最大的 意识形态堡垒，虽然他们否定自己没有意识形态，但他们的观点充斥着主观，他们选择的经典充斥着一些选择、歧视；有自己的for 和against。
- The world itself is so complicated that I can't figure it out!

## • Characteristics of Post-Colonial Criticism:
- Seeks to come to terms with the legacy of European colonialism from a global perspective
- Examines the effects of colonial rule on both the colonized societies and the imperial powers
- ==Explores the relationship between culture, race, nationality, and imperialism==
- Challenges the ethnocentric foundations of traditional English/Western literature

## • Representative Writers/Theorists:
- Edward Said (Orientalism, Culture and Imperialism)
- Homi K. Bhabha
- Gayatri Spivak
- Kwame Anthony Appiah
- Gauri Viswanathan (Masks of Conquest)
- Bill Ashcroft, Gareth Griffiths, and Helen Tiffin (The Empire Writes Back)

## • Duration/Timeline:
- Post-colonial studies emerged in the wake of the independence of formerly colonized territories, primarily after World War II
- Gained prominence in the Anglo-American academy in the late 1980s and early 1990s

## • Other People's Comments/Perspectives:
- According to Gerald Graff, post-colonial studies have been accommodated as a field within the discipline of English literature without fundamentally changing the discipline's structure or traditional approaches
- Graff argues that the "field-coverage principle" in English departments allows for the incorporation of new fields without requiring changes in other fields or challenging the discipline's overall coherence
- **The author of the PDF suggests that post-colonial criticism may have had a radical impact on English literature's foundations, but the discipline has remained largely unchanged by incorporating it as a marginal field of study.**

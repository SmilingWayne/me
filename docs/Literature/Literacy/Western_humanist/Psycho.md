# Freud


#### A form of criticism

- Developed by Freud
- A form of therapy which aims to cure mental disorders “**by investigating the interaction of conscious and unconscious elements in the mind.**” 
- The traditional way or method is to get the patient to talk freely, in such a way that the repressed fears and conflicts which are causing the problems are brought into the conscious mind.
- Based on specific theories of ==how mind , the instincts, and sexuality work== .
- A form of literary criticism


#### Freudian ideas:

- Concerning aspects of sexuality, knowns as infantile sexuality, the notion that sexuality begins not at puberty, with physical maturing, but in infancy, especially through the infant’s relationship with the mother.
- Connected with this is the Oedipus Complex, by this Freud says that the male infant conceives the desire to eliminate the father and become the sexual partner of the mother.
- Often deeply masculinist in bias.

### What Freudia psychoanalytic critics do?

- Give central importance to the distinction between the conscious and the unconscious mind. Associate the literary work’s overt content with the covert content
- Pay close attention to unconscious motives and feelings, whether these be (a) those of the author, or (be) those of the characters depicted in the work.
- Demonstrate the presence in the literary work of classic psychoanalytic symptoms, conditions, or phases , such as the oral, anal, and phallic stages of emotional and sexual development in infants
- Make large-scale applications of psychoanalytic concepts to literary history in general, for example, Harold Bloom’s book **The Anxiety of Influence** sees the struggle for identity by each generation of poets as an enactment of the  **Oedipus complex**(俄狄浦斯情结)
- Identify  a psychic context for the literary work, at the expense of social or historical context



### What Lacanian critics do?

- Pay close attention to unconscious motives and feelings, but instead of digging those of the author or characters, they search out those of the text, uncovering contradictory undercurrents of meaning（潜意识的动机：undercurrents）
- Demonstrate the presence in the literary work of Lacanian psychoanalytic symptoms or phases, such as the mirror-stage or the sovereignty of the unconscious(拉康精神分析 / 镜像状态 / 无意识的统治)
- Treat the literary text in terms of Lacanian orientations, towards such concepts as lack or desire（欲望）
- See the literary text as an enactment or demonstration of Lacanian views about language and the unconscious, challenging the conventions of literary representation (the endemic elusiveness of the signified, and the centrality of the unconscious)



### Later psychoanalytical theory

- Adaptations of Carl Jung’s theories evolved into archetypal criticism
- Lacan & Kristeva are the best known “neo-Freudians”
  - Their theory is language-centered rather than biology centered
  - They apply insights of poststructuralist theories of meaning & of the human subject


- Lacan:
  - Proposing 3 stages of development that occur between birth and age 2-3: the Real, the Imaginary, and the Symbolic
  - As the baby grows, it begins to have more control over its own movements and actions, but having no sense of “self”, it is pacified by the caregiver, breast or bottle or pacifier
The mirror stage later
  - To Lacan, the ego, self, or “I”dentity is always on some level a **Fantasy**, an identification with an external image and not an internal sense of separate whole identity.
  - Lacan highlights the importance of the idea of “other”. He distinguishes between the capital-o Other as center and small-o others who inhabit subject positions within the Symbolic Order and who are subjected to the governance of the center.

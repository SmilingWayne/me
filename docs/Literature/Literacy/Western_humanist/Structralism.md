## 索绪尔
- The meaning of the word is **arbitrary**.🌟, This is also maintained by convention. Words are not motivated signs. **There are no inherent meanings**.
- Based on ==arbitrariness==. Language is not a reflection of the world and experience but a system which stands quite separate from it.
    - If there are some inherent connection between word and object, we would expect that all languages would use the same signifier to represent the signified.
- What is a **sign**?
    - made of a signifier and a signified whose connection is arbitrary.
- **Relational!**🌟? No words can be defined as isolation.
- 索绪尔的例子：怎么确定identify这个列车？它载的人不同、出发时间不同、他可能引擎不同、乘客不同等等；**relational**；

- **Constitutive**:建构性的？
    - meanings is constructed and expressed through language. Not already contained within the things.
    - processed food. Because authors used it in various ways. 


- **Stop and think**:
  
- Agenda and assumptions
- dymustify the literature

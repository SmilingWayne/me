# Gender and Sexuality

- performance and performativity：什么区别：表演和表演性？
  - （Judith Butler）在20世纪90年代发展了表演性的概念，以描述性别是如何构建的。巴特勒认为，性别是一个持续的和社会建构的过程，它通过一系列连续的表演行为进行，例如，从“这是一个男孩！“一个人的一生。因此，表演性是主体形成的过程，它创造了它所要描述的东西，并通过语言手段以及其他社会实践发生。
- body become a signifying system within social formations
- Influenced by Michel Foucault's theories of sexuality.
  - social constructionism
  - History of Sexuality：Foucault真是大恶人，什么事情都可以溯源到他这里
  - "A regulated and polymorphous incitement to discourse"
- Althusser: 阿尔都塞
- Judith Butler：朱迪斯·巴特勒

- Queer theory:Teresa de Lauretis
- Levi-Strauss: analysis of kinship: women as gifts, exchanges between men.
- Lesbian Feminism is not concerned with hating men but rather with celebrating the life choices of women who love women.

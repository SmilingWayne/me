### Deconstruct

- deconstruct it to texts: (culture / politics / history ... )
  - One can understand the rile of female through lens of feminist philosophy
  - ==No actual referent or object that a word represents==  ,The meaning always depends on others' **interpretations / signifiers**.
    - signify the signifier: 椅子 = Chair,(The thing you sit on) ; 两者是相互的。
    - connection is loosey and poetic:
    - difference : " to differ " / " to defer ": 含义无法被精准地追溯、了解
    - There can be no Truth in language: u can never get to the definitive meaning , the fixed , stable meaning unitary meaning. 无法确切地得知一个词语的含义



#### Def. A philosophied movement and theory of literary criticism that 
  - questions traditional assumptions about certainty, identity and truth.
  - asserts that words can only refer to other words.
  - attempts to demonstrate how statements about any text subverts their own meanings.


#### Core: Pulling apart: breaking!
  - a tendency to subvert or pull apart and examine existing conventions having to do with meaning and individualism
  - highly subjective nature of demonstration, different authors have different understaning, the application of the theory in criticism and art **vary greatly!**


- **Interrogation**
- interrogate the assumptions of western thought by reversing of displacing the hierarchical "binary opposition" that provides its foundations.


#### How is meaning produced?
- speech has to articulate to make any sense whatever
- 构建、建构：用语言建构起来的，有一定逻辑和思想的。
- pervasive 
- constructs prouce meaning only through the interplay of differences within a system of distinct signs
  - summarize / conclude
- emerges from saussure

#### Tasks of deconstruction 

- overturn the hierarchy at a given moment.

## Tradition and the Individual Talent


> Author(s): T. S. Eliot
> 
> Source: Perspecta , 1982, Vol. 19 (1982), pp. 36-42



### Central Idea:
-  The concept of "tradition" is crucial for a poet to develop their individual talent fully
-  A poet must have a "historical sense" and be aware of the entire literary tradition, seeing it as a simultaneous order
-  A new work of art modifies and gets integrated into the existing order of literary works

### Writer's Opinions:
- Mere novelty or originality should not be the aim of a poet
- A poet's most individual parts may be those where they are most connected to the past poets/tradition
- Poetry is not the expression of a poet's personality, but an escape from personality
- The poet's mind is a catalytic medium that combines ordinary emotions into new, impersonal art emotions

### Purpose of the Text:
-  To redefine the role of tradition and its relationship with individual talent in poetry
-  To challenge the Romantic idea of poetry as an expression of the poet's personal emotions
-  To propose an "impersonal theory of poetry" where the focus shifts from the poet to the poem itself
-  To argue for judging poetry based on its relation to the entire literary tradition rather than just novelty

> Overall, Eliot makes a case for tradition being essential for great poetry, and the poet needing to transcend their individual personality to create impersonal, objective works of art that engage with the entire literary heritage. The text aims to provide a new theoretical framework for understanding and evaluating poetry.

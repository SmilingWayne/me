Understanding New Criticism：
Ambiguity • It occurs when a word, image, or event generates two or more different meaning.
Example: “Thanks for dinner. I’ve never seen potatoes cooked like that before.” (Jonah Baldwin in the film Sleepless in Seattle, 1993)
Paradox • It typically arise from false assumptions, which then lead to inconsistencies between observed and expected behavior.
Example: “Someday you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again.” (C.S. Lewis to his godchild, Lucy Barfield, to whom he dedicated The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe)
Irony • a figure of speech in which words are used in such a way that their intended meaning is different from the actual meaning of the words.
Example: “Once in the winter the rector would come to dine, and her husband would beg her to go over the list and see that no divorcees were included, except those who had showed signs of penitence by being remarried to very wealthy” (Edith Wharton’s House of Mirth (1905)
 
“The ideology of New Criticism began to crystallize: scientific rationalism was ravaging the “aesthetic life” of the old South, human experience was being stripped of its sensuous particularity, and poetry was a possible solution. The poetic response, unlike the scientific, respected the sensuous integrity of its object: it was not a matter of rational cognition but an affective affair which linked us to the “world’s body” in an essentially religious bond. Through art, an alienated world could be restored to us in all its rich variousness. Poetry, as an essentially contemplative mode, would spur us not to change the world but to reverence it for what it was, teach us to approach it with a disinterested humility.” --- Terry Eagleton, Literary Theory, An Introduction, p 40.
 
Question: Explain and illustrate two of the following five literary terminologies endemic to New Criticism: irony, tension, ambiguity, the intentional fallacy and the affective fallacy. Your answer should be around 200 words. 


Affective fallacy: New critics takes the emotional effect that poems exert on readers as some kind of misconception. To them, the only thing that matters is the text itself, which symphasizes on the independence of text from extrinstic elements like authors' experience, historical background and relions. These extrinstic factors violate the purity of dictions and are less important than the phrases and words, thus confused the text with the emotional and psychological response of its readers. As Eliot put it, the only legitimate context is the "organic wholes" of literature itself. The focus of the literary can and only can be the text, regardless of historical, social, religionious factors. A great metaphor given by Wimsatt and Beardsley, who first put the term forward, said that "...text was an autonomous entity, independent of both author and reader, and its merit and meaning was considered to be inherent and not attributed. ". They expelled the readers and leave text alone.


Intentional fallacy: It's a term used by new critics in 20th century. Formulated by Wimsat and Beardsley in 1946, the term was to describe such a mistake that critics attempt to understand the intentions of the autors while interpreting the literary work. In fact, in their perspective, the judgement of intention of the author is not desirable and even unavailable, which just reflects their advocate of "autotetic text". T.S Eliot argued in 1919 that "Honest criticism... are directed not upon the poet but upon the poetry". The Intentional fallacy is a clear reject of romantic concept of literature as a vehicle of personal expression. Just like Affective Fallacy, the goal of advocating Intentional is to defend the purity of text. The new critics not only said No to the interference of readers, but also put authors in a distant position. By doing so, the text can finally "be an organic text"

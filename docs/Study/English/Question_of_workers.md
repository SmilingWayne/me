    （中文译者：冯至）    


Who built Thebes of the 7 gates ? 

In the books you will read the names of kings. 

Did the kings haul up the lumps of rock ? 

And Babylon, many times demolished, 

Who raised it up so many times ? 

In what houses of gold glittering Lima did its builders live ? 

Where, the evening that the Great Wall of China was finished, did the masons go?


Great Rome is full of triumphal arches. 

Who erected them ? 

Over whom did the Caesars triumph ? 

Had Byzantium, much praised in song, only palaces for its inhabitants ? 

Even in fabled Atlantis, the night that the ocean engulfed it, 

The drowning still cried out for their slaves. 

The young Alexander conquered India.

Was he alone ? 

Caesar defeated the Gauls. 

Did he not even have a cook with him ? 

Philip of Spain wept when his armada went down. 

Was he the only one to weep ?  

Frederick the 2nd won the 7 Years War. 

Who else won it ? 

Every page a victory. 

Who cooked the feast for the victors ? 

Every 10 years a great man. 

Who paid the bill ? 

So many reports.  

So many questions.

七个城门的底比斯是谁建造的？

书本上列了一些国王的名字。

石头和砖块是国王搬的吗？

还有巴比伦，一再被摧毁

是谁又一再将她重建？

金光闪闪的利马的建筑工人，

他们住的房子在什么地方？

砌了一天的城墙，天黑之后，

万里长城的泥水匠在哪里过夜？

雄伟的罗马到处都有凯旋门。

那是谁打造的？那些罗马皇帝

战胜的又是谁？

大名鼎鼎的拜占庭

它的居民都住在宫殿吗？

传说中的亚特兰提斯，

大海先淹没奴隶，然后

那些主子才漂浮在黑夜的汪洋中哀嚎。


年轻的亚历山大征服了印度。

就凭他一人吗？

西泽打败了高卢人，

他该不会连个煮饭的都没带吧？


无敌舰队沉没的时候，

西班牙的腓力哭了。

没有别的人哭吗？

腓特烈大帝在七年战争中获胜。

除了他还有谁获胜？


页页有胜利。

谁来准备庆功宴？

代代出伟人。

谁来买单？

一大堆史实。

一大堆疑问。

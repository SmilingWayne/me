# 罗密欧与朱丽叶

```
She doth teaches the torches to burn bright, 
it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night.

As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear,
Beauty too rich for use, for earth to dear.

So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
As yonder lady o’er her fellow shows.

Did my heart love till now?
Forswear it sight, for I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.

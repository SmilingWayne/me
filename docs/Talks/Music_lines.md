### 加州旅馆（Hotel California）

On a dark desert highway cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
This could be Heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Such a lovely face
Plenty of rooms at the Hotel California 
Any time of year you can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany- twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
**Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget**
So I called up the Captain
Please bring me my wine
He said
=="We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"==
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
They living it up at the Hotel California
What nice surprise
What nice surprise
Bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling
Pink champagne on ice
She said
**We are all just prisoners here, Of our own device**
In the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stabbed it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage Back
To the place I was before
Relax said the night man
We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave
